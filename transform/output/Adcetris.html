         <quote></quote>
         <quote>Peripheral neuropathy: Treating physicians should monitor patients for neuropathy
            and institute dose modifications accordingly (5.1).  Infusion reactions: If an infusion reaction occurs, the infusion should be interrupted
            and appropriate medical management instituted. If anaphylaxis occurs, the infusion
            should be discontinued immediately and appropriate medical management instituted (5.2).  Neutropenia: Monitor complete blood counts prior to each dose of ADCETRIS. If Grade
            3 or 4 neutropenia develops, manage by G-CSF support, dose delays, reductions or discontinuation
            (5.3).  Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Patients with rapidly proliferating tumor and high tumor burden
            are at risk of tumor lysis syndrome and these patients should be monitored closely
            and appropriate measures taken (5.4).  Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML): Monitor neurologic function; hold
            ADCETRIS if PML is suspected and discontinue ADCETRIS if PML is confirmed&nbsp;&nbsp;(5.5).  Stevens-Johnson syndrome: If Stevens-Johnson syndrome occurs, discontinue ADCETRIS
            and administer appropriate medical therapy (5.6).  Embryo-fetal toxicity: Fetal harm can occur. Pregnant women should be advised of the
            potential hazard to the fetus (5.7).

         <h3>5.1 Peripheral Neuropathy</h3>
         <quote>
            <p>ADCETRIS treatment causes a peripheral neuropathy that is predominantly sensory. Cases
               of peripheral motor neuropathy have also been reported. ADCETRIS-induced peripheral
               neuropathy is cumulative. In the HL and sALCL clinical trials, 54% of patients experienced
               any grade of neuropathy. Of these patients, 49% had complete resolution, 31% had partial
               improvement, and 20% had no improvement. Of the patients who reported neuropathy,
               51% had residual neuropathy at the time of their last evaluation. Monitor patients
               for symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort,
               a burning sensation, neuropathic pain or weakness. Patients experiencing new or worsening
               peripheral neuropathy may require a delay, change in dose, or discontinuation of ADCETRIS&nbsp;[see Dose Modification (2.2) ].

         <h3>5.2 Infusion Reactions</h3>
         <quote>
            <p>Infusion-related reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred with ADCETRIS. Monitor
               patients during infusion. If anaphylaxis occurs, immediately and permanently discontinue
               administration of ADCETRIS and administer appropriate medical therapy. If an infusion-related
               reaction occurs, the infusion should be interrupted and appropriate medical management
               instituted. Patients who have experienced a prior infusion-related reaction should
               be premedicated for subsequent infusions. Premedication may include acetaminophen,
               an antihistamine and a corticosteroid.
            </p>
         </quote>
         <h3>5.3 Neutropenia</h3>
         <quote>
            <p>Complete blood counts should be monitored prior to each dose of ADCETRIS and more
               frequent monitoring should be considered for patients with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia.
               Prolonged (≥1 week) severe neutropenia can occur with ADCETRIS. If Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia
               develops, manage by G-CSF support, dose delays, reductions, or discontinuations [see Dose Modification (2.2)].
            </p>

         <h3>5.4 Tumor Lysis Syndrome</h3>
         <quote>
            <p>Tumor lysis syndrome may occur. Patients with rapidly proliferating tumor and high
               tumor burden may be at increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Monitor closely and
               take appropriate measures.
            </p>
         </quote>
         <h3>5.5 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy</h3>
         <quote>
            <p>JC virus infection resulting in PML and death has been reported in ADCETRIS-treated
               patients. In addition to ADCETRIS therapy, other possible contributory factors include
               prior therapies and underlying disease that may cause immunosuppression.
            </p>
            <p>Consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with new-onset signs and symptoms
               of central nervous system abnormalities. Evaluation of PML includes, but is not limited
               to, consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture or brain biopsy.
               Hold ADCETRIS dosing for any suspected case of PML and discontinue ADCETRIS dosing
               if a diagnosis of PML is confirmed.
            </p>

         <h3>5.6 Stevens-Johnson Syndrome</h3>
         <quote>
            <p>Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been reported with ADCETRIS. If Stevens-Johnson syndrome
               occurs, discontinue ADCETRIS and administer appropriate medical therapy.
            </p>
         </quote>
         <h3>5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3>
         <quote>
            <p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ADCETRIS in pregnant women. However,
               based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, ADCETRIS can cause fetal
               harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Brentuximab vedotin caused embryo-fetal
               toxicities, including significantly decreased embryo viability and fetal malformations,
               in animals at maternal exposures that were similar to human exposures at the recommended
               doses for patients with HL and sALCL.If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if
               the patient becomes pregnant while receiving the drug, the patient should be apprised
               of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

         <h3>6.1 Clinical Trial Experience</h3>
         <quote>
            <p>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction
               rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in
               the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
            </p>
            <p>ADCETRIS was studied as monotherapy in 160 patients in two phase 2 trials. Across
               both trials, the most common adverse reactions (≥20%), regardless of causality, were
               neutropenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue, nausea, anemia, upper respiratory
               tract infection, diarrhea, pyrexia, rash, thrombocytopenia, cough and vomiting. The
               most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients in either trial,
               regardless of causality, using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Version 3.0, are shown
               in Table 1.
            </p>
            <p>Experience in Hodgkin Lymphoma</p>
            <p>ADCETRIS was studied in 102 patients with HL in a single arm clinical trial in which
               the recommended starting dose and schedule was 1.8 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks.
               Median duration of treatment was 27 weeks (range, 3 to 56 weeks)&nbsp; [see Clinical Studies (14)].
            </p>
            <p>The most common adverse reactions (≥20%), regardless of causality, were neutropenia,
               peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea,
               diarrhea, anemia, pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, rash, abdominal pain, cough, and vomiting.
            </p>
            <p>Experience in Systemic Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma</p>
            <p>ADCETRIS was studied in 58 patients with sALCL in a single arm clinical trial in which
               the recommended starting dose and schedule was 1.8 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks.
               Median duration of treatment was 24 weeks (range, 3 to 56 weeks) [see Clinical Studies (14)].
            </p>
            <p>The most common adverse reactions (≥20%), regardless of causality, were neutropenia,
               anemia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue, nausea, pyrexia, rash, diarrhea, and

            <p>Two cases of anaphylaxis were reported in phase 1 trials. There were no Grade 3 or
               4 infusion-related reactions reported in the phase 2 trials, however, Grade 1 or 2
               infusion-related reactions were reported for 19 patients (12%). The most common adverse
               reactions (≥2%) associated with infusion-related reactions were chills (4%), nausea
               (3%), dyspnea (3%), pruritus (3%), pyrexia (2%), and cough (2%).
            </p>
            <p> Serious adverse reactions</p>
            <p>In the phase 2 trials, serious adverse reactions, regardless of causality, were reported
               in 31% of patients receiving ADCETRIS. The most common serious adverse reactions experienced
               by patients with HL include peripheral motor neuropathy (4%), abdominal pain (3%),
               pulmonary embolism (2%), pneumonitis (2%), pneumothorax (2%), pyelonephritis (2%),
               and pyrexia (2%). The most common serious adverse reactions experienced by patients
               with sALCL were septic shock (3%), supraventricular arrhythmia (3%), pain in extremity
               (3%), and urinary tract infection (3%). Other important serious adverse reactions
               reported include PML, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and tumor lysis syndrome.

         <h3>6.2 Post Marketing Experience</h3>
         <quote>
            <p>The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ADCETRIS.
               Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size,
               it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal
               relationship to drug exposure.

            <p>Cases of PML have been reported [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].</p>
         </quote>
         <h3>6.3 Immunogenicity</h3>
         <quote>
            <p>Patients with HL and sALCL in the phase 2 trials [see Clinical Studies (14)] were tested for antibodies to brentuximab vedotin every 3 weeks using a sensitive
               electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. Approximately 7% of patients in these trials
               developed persistently positive antibodies (positive test at more than 2 timepoints)
               and 30% developed transiently positive antibodies (positive in 1 or 2 post-baseline
               timepoints). The anti-brentuximab antibodies were directed against the antibody component
               of brentuximab vedotin in all patients with transiently or persistently positive antibodies.
               Two of the patients (1%) with persistently positive antibodies experienced adverse
               reactions consistent with infusion reactions that led to discontinuation of treatment.
               Overall, a higher incidence of infusion related reactions was observed in patients
               who developed persistently positive antibodies.
            </p>
            <p>A total of 58 patient samples that were either transiently or persistently positive
               for anti-brentuximab vedotin antibodies were tested for the presence of neutralizing
               antibodies. Sixty-two percent of these patients had at least one sample that was positive
               for the presence of neutralizing antibodies. The effect of anti-brentuximab vedotin
               antibodies on safety and efficacy is not known.
            </p>
            <p>Immunogenicity assay results are highly dependent on several factors including assay
               sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample
               collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison
               of incidence of antibodies to ADCETRIS with the incidence of antibodies to other products
               may be misleading.

         <h3>8.1 Pregnancy</h3>
         <quote>
            <p>Pregnancy Category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].</p>
            <p>Risk Summary</p>
            <p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with ADCETRIS in pregnant women.
               However, based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, ADCETRIS can cause
               fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Brentuximab vedotin caused embryo-fetal
               toxicities in animals at maternal exposures that were similar to human exposures at
               the recommended doses for patients with HL and sALCL. If this drug is used during
               pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient
               should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.
            </p>
            <p>Animal Data</p>
            <p>In an embryo-fetal developmental study, pregnant rats received 2 intravenous doses
               of 0.3, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin during the period of organogenesis (once
               each on Pregnancy Days 6 and 13). Drug-induced embryo-fetal toxicities were seen mainly
               in animals treated with 3&nbsp;and 10 mg/kg of the drug and included increased early resorption
               (≥99%), post-implantation loss (≥99%), decreased numbers of live fetuses, and external
               malformations (i.e., umbilical hernias and malrotated hindlimbs). Systemic exposure
               in animals at the brentuximab vedotin dose of 3 mg/kg is approximately the same exposure
               in patients with HL or sALCL who received the recommended dose of 1.8 mg/kg every
               three weeks.

         <h3>8.3 Nursing Mothers</h3>
         <quote>
            <p>It is not known whether brentuximab vedotin is excreted in human milk. Because many
               drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse
               reactions in nursing infants from ADCETRIS a decision should be made whether to discontinue
               nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug
               to the mother.

            <p>The safety and effectiveness of ADCETRIS have not been established in the pediatric
               population. Clinical trials of ADCETRIS included only 9 pediatric patients and this
               number is not sufficient to determine whether they respond differently than adult
               patients.
