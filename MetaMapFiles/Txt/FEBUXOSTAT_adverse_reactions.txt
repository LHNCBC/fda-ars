  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 A total of 2757 subjects with hyperuricemia and gout were treated with ULORIC 40 mg or 80 mg daily in clinical studies. For ULORIC 40 mg, 559 patients were treated for >=6 months. For ULORIC 80 mg, 1377 subjects were treated for >=6 months, 674 patients were treated for >=1 year and 515 patients were treated for >=2 years.



   Most Common Adverse Reactions  



 In three randomized, controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2 and 3), which were six to 12 months in duration, the following adverse reactions were reported by the treating physician as related to study drug. Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported at a rate of at least 1% in ULORIC treatment groups and at least 0.5% greater than placebo.




  Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring in >=1% of ULORIC-Treated Patients and at Least 0.5%Greater than Seen in Patients Receiving Placebo in Controlled Studies

           The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation from therapy was liver function abnormalities in 1.8% of ULORIC 40 mg, 1.2% of ULORIC 80 mg, and in 0.9% of allopurinol-treated subjects.
 

 In addition to the adverse reactions presented in Table 1, dizziness was reported in more than 1% of ULORIC-treated subjects although not at a rate more than 0.5% greater than placebo.

   Cardiovascular Safety  



 Cardiovascular events and deaths were adjudicated to one of the pre-defined endpoints from the Anti-Platelet Trialists' Collaborations (APTC) (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke) in the randomized controlled and long-term extension studies. In the Phase 3 randomized controlled studies, the incidences of adjudicated APTC events per 100 patient-years of exposure were: Placebo 0 (95% CI 0.00-6.16), ULORIC 40 mg 0 (95% CI 0.00-1.08), ULORIC 80 mg 1.09 (95% CI 0.44-2.24), and allopurinol 0.60 (95% CI 0.16-1.53).



 In the long-term extension studies, the incidences of adjudicated APTC events were: ULORIC 80 mg 0.97 (95% CI 0.57-1.56), and allopurinol 0.58 (95% CI 0.02-3.24).



 Overall, a higher rate of APTC events was observed in ULORIC than in allopurinol-treated patients. A causal relationship with ULORIC has not been established. Monitor for signs and symptoms of MI and stroke.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  Adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ULORIC. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship.



   Hepatobiliary Disorders:  hepatic failure (some fatal), jaundice, serious cases of abnormal liver function test results, liver disorder.



   Immune System Disorders:  anaphylaxis, anaphylactic reaction.



   Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders:  rhabdomyolysis.



   Psychiatric Disorders:  psychotic behavior including aggressive thoughts.



   Renal and Urinary Disorders:  tubulointerstitial nephritis.



   Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:  generalized rash, Stevens Johnson Syndrome, hypersensitivity skin reactions.
