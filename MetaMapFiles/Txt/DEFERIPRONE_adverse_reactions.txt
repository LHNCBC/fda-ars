  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  The following adverse reactions are also discussed in other sections of the labeling: Agranulocytosis/Neutropenia  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  . Elevated ALT  (5.3)  , Decreased plasma zinc concentrations  (5.3)  .



 Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 Adverse reaction information for Ferriprox represents the pooled data collected from 642 patients who participated in single arm or active-controlled clinical studies.



 The most serious adverse reaction reported in clinical trials with Ferriprox was agranulocytosis  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .



 The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials were chromaturia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, alanine aminotransferase increased, arthralgia and neutropenia.



 The table below lists the adverse drug reactions that occurred in at least 1% of patients treated with Ferriprox in clinical trials.

      Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain were the most frequent adverse reactions reported by patients participating in clinical trials and led to the discontinuation of Ferriprox therapy in 1.6% of patients.
 

 Chromaturia (reddish/brown discoloration of the urine) is a result of the excretion of the iron in the urine.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience
